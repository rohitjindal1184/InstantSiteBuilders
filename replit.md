# InstantSiteBuilders - Full-Stack Web Application

## Overview

InstantSiteBuilders is a full-stack web application that provides fast, affordable website and app development services for individuals and small businesses. The application features a modern React frontend with a contact form system and an Express.js backend with PostgreSQL database integration.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management
- **UI Framework**: shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom CSS variables for theming
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Database Provider**: Neon Database (serverless PostgreSQL)
- **Validation**: Zod schemas for type-safe data validation
- **Development**: TSX for TypeScript execution

## Key Components

### Database Schema (`shared/schema.ts`)
- **Users Table**: Basic user authentication with username/password
- **Contact Submissions Table**: Stores contact form submissions with metadata
- **Validation**: Zod schemas for type safety and input validation

### API Endpoints (`server/routes.ts`)
- `POST /api/contact` - Submit contact form with validation
- `GET /api/contact-submissions` - Retrieve all contact submissions (admin)

### Frontend Pages

- **404 Page**: Custom not-found page

### UI Components
- Complete shadcn/ui component library
- Custom form components with validation
- Responsive design with mobile support

## Data Flow

1. **Contact Form Submission**:
   - User fills out contact form on home page
   - React Hook Form handles form state and validation
   - Zod schema validates data on client-side
   - API request sent to `/api/contact` endpoint
   - Server validates data again with same Zod schema
   - Data stored in PostgreSQL database via Drizzle ORM
   - Success/error feedback shown via toast notifications

2. **Analytics Integration**:
   - Google Analytics 4 integration for tracking
   - Page view tracking on route changes
   - Event tracking for form submissions
